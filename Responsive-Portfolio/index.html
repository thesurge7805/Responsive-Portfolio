            <p>Born and raised in the southwest side of Chicago. After high school I did
                a 4 year enlistment with the United States Marine Corps. In the Marines, I 
                deployed twice, one to Fallujah Iraq, and an expiditionary unit deployment
                which had me sail around southwest Asia and the Middle East on a Navy ship.
                After my discharge I moved to Las Vegas where I worked security at the Tropicana
                Hotel and Casino for around 1 Year. After that I enrolled in Roosevelt University
                to persue a criminal justice degree. Bouncing around various jobs and the boredom of 
                bieng over-qualified for almost every job I have had has motivated me to take on the 
                challenge of this Bootcamp.
